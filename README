== Introduction ==

This is the new version of rexeno.
It is designed to become the 1.0 version.
Enjoy !

== Configuration ==
sudo apt-get install make
sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install nvidia-current

== Installation Rexeno Libraries ==

Use lower level command line (recommanded to understand what is going on) :

On a Xenomai Box :
cd /to/the/rexeno/source/folder
mkdir build
cmake .. -DXENO=ON  -DDIR3PARTY=/path/to/rexeno/3rdparties/linux-ububuntu-12-04-[no]xeno/target
make
sudo make install

On a regular linux box :
cd /to/the/rexeno/source/folder
mkdir build
cmake .. -DXENO=OFF -DDIR3PARTY=/path/to/rexeno/3rdparties/linux-ububuntu-12-04-[no]xeno/target -DDEBUG=1
make
sudo make install

== Create a new protocole from scratch ==

Once the rexeno project installed, you can have access to several tools to create you new protocole :


== Trace Information == 

In XENO=OFF, the program tries to crash as soon as possible and give you information about what his problem was.
In XENO=ON, many trace information will be missing for optimisation purpose. Don't expect them all.

== Options ==

= in ~/.rexeno configuration file =

height : height of the subject's screen (cm)
width : width of the subject's screen (cm)
refresh : refresh rate of screens (Hz)
distance : how far is the subject from the screen (cm)

= in the definition file =

name : name of the protocole for this session (string)

x_channel : driver channel used for X (not yet functional, right now is 0) (integer)

y_channel : driver channel used for X (not yet functional, right now is 1) (integer)

coordonate : right now only pcent is functional
- pcent (ie percentage of the screen)
- cm (ie real centimenters, be careful to have set correctly height and witdth in the configuration file)
- degrees (be careful to have set correctly height, witdth AND distance in the configuration file)

driver : xeno | dummy | file:<filename>

calibration:
- keyboard
- matrix:<filename>
- no

= in the command line =

None : we keep the command line available for use defined options
